<What the fuck do we put here for FIVE PAGES>


-- Notes:

Describe in crisp terms the algorithm. Use an example. Describe how you have implemented the algorithm using software. This would involve mentioning which containers were used where, what data items were implemented as variables and what items were computed on the fly as needed, etc.

My guess is that you can describe the algorithm in two pages, single spaced, including some pictures. Feel free to cut and paste hand drawn pictures scanned in. My guess is that the rough outline of the software can be done in two pages or less. And the whole document can be done in about five pages single spaced.

The union-find algorithm has a nice feature to it. If the arc that one is considering adding to the forest of trees would make a cycle, then the arc is not added to the forest of trees, but the cycle can be output for later processing. If another arc comes along that would create a cycle from some or all of the arcs in the first cycle, then the new arc is also not added, but the new cycle can also be output. Because of the way the cycles are generated, one does not have to keep track of the context of cycles or the multiplicity of cycles involving certain nodes. They all wind up essentially independent of one another.
