Union Find Algorithm
===============
This program computes indpendent cycles in an undirected graph using the union find algorithm. 

The program takes in the input in the following fashion through STDIN

5
  0   1
  0   2
  1   2
  2   3
  3   4
  
Where the first number gives the number of arcs and the couplets give the connection between vertices.
